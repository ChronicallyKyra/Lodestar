Lodestar is a package manager daemon written for developers with customizeablility and modularity as the main focus.  If you're a user looking for an app to use for their Minecraft mods, this isn't exactly for you.  You can try out the first-party CLI [Stargazer](https://github.com/vividuwu/stargazer) or one of the other user-made frontends.  These could take the form of anything, whether that be a CLI, UI app, mod from within the game, or even a website.
