<h2>What? and Why?</h2>

Lodestar is a backend that exposes a [Dbus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) interface for installing and managing Minecraft mods, resource packs, plugins, worlds, and more.
This is where the hackable part of my fancy description comes in: Lodestar provides all of the tools and functionality for package management over Dbus, meaning that any frontend can be can be written, whether that be a CLI, UI app, mod from within the game, or even a website.
<br>

If you like CLIs, the companion app [Gazer](https://github.com/vividuwu/gazer) is written just for this
